Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.

Example 1:
<pre>
Input: [1,4,3,2]

Output: 4
</pre>
Explanation: n is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is 4.
