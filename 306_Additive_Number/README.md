Additive number is a string whose digits can form additive sequence.

A valid additive sequence should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

For example:
<pre>
"112358" is an additive number because the digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.

1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
</pre>
<pre>
"199100199" is also an additive number, the additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.
1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
</pre>
Note: Numbers in the additive sequence cannot have leading zeros, so sequence 1, 2, 03 or 1, 02, 3 is invalid.

Given a string containing only digits '0'-'9', write a function to determine if it's an additive number.

**Note**  
* Use itertools.combinations() to enumerate all combinations
* Use str(int(a)) != a to determine whether the input str containing leading 0s
* Use str.startswith(pattern, index) to check whether it is additive
