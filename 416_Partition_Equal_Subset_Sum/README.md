Given a non-empty array containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Note:
Each of the array element will not exceed 100.
The array size will not exceed 200.

Example 1:

<pre>
Input: [1, 5, 11, 5]

Output: true
</pre>

Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].

Example 2:

<pre>
Input: [1, 2, 3, 5]

Output: false
</pre>

Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
