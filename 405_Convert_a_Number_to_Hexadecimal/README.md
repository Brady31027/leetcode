Given an integer, write an algorithm to convert it to hexadecimal. For negative integer, twoâ€™s complement method is used.

Note:

All letters in hexadecimal (a-f) must be in lowercase.
The hexadecimal string must not contain extra leading 0s. If the number is zero, it is represented by a single zero character '0'; otherwise, the first character in the hexadecimal string will not be the zero character.
The given number is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You must not use any method provided by the library which converts/formats the number to hex directly.
Example 1:
<pre>
Input:
26

Output:
"1a"
</pre>
  
Example 2:
<pre>
Input:
-1

Output:
"ffffffff"
</pre>

**Note**  
* Notice the negative number, e.g. -1
  * num = num + 0x100000000
  * e.g. -1 to 0xFFFFFFFF
