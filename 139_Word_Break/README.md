Given a non-empty string s and a dictionary wordDict containing a list of non-empty words, determine if s can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words. You may assume the dictionary does not contain duplicate words.

For example, given
<pre>
s = "leetcode",
dict = ["leet", "code"].
</pre>
Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
